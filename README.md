# neural-nets
Code and Jupyter Notebook to accompany the problems in coding_task.pdf

A simple, feed foward neural network class that provides basic functionality needed to complete the Coding Problem in `coding_task.pdf`.
A Jupyter notebook `coding_task.ipynb` accompanies this module and demonstrates basic usage of the `FullyConnectedNet` class.

To view the Jupyter notebook, ensure that [`jupyter`](http://jupyter.org/install.html) is installed and then run
```bash
$ jupyter notebook coding_task.ipynb
```
which will open the notebook in your browser.
